“Grab a Bite!” is an app that takes the stress out of date night. Using our clean, sleek interface you simply put into your location and WHAM you’ve got a date. 

Ever disappointed your partner?  

Well do we have an app for you. 

Fallen into a take out rut? Looking to explore new artisanal cuisine while getting the approval from the missus or mister, respectively? 

Our app sought to reinvigorate your restaurant experience. At any moment, from any location you may be in, we indulge your greatest whimsy and your most primal hunger--hunger. With additional information provided--free of cost-- regarding type of cuisine offered and a link that takes your directly to the webpage of the hottest spots in town, all that’s missing is you.

In the end, after many failed attempts, much frustration, more learning, and lots of love we landed on something functional.

Matt emerged as the front end leader for the team, racing to create dynamic web pages based on the rest of the teams enthusiasm alone, because what happened several times was that we just could not find the API’s to make our dreams come true. Visually, however, Matt took us there. In the final project, he succeeded in making the interface clean, classy, and minimalistic. 

As for the rest of the group, it was a scramble to find a working API. The APIs available were either niche (IP tracker), unusable (TasteDive), or tainted by CORS or JSONP (Evently). But, eventually George found Leaflet.js and made it his own, struggling and overcoming the new data and incorporating flags and dynamic maps into the final project webpage. Philip and Maeve went through a number of mismatches before finding Zomato. An issue faced with Zomato was a very specific and obscure location issue for towns, counties, and states. Unbeknownst to us, Zomato asserts that Raleigh exists in the state of ‘Research Triangle,’ while Zomato exists in a state of denial. With rampant miscategorized cities and states, we were stalled several hours as we learned the nuances of this free API (initially we thought the ‘free’ component was a virtue, while eventually we found it to be a curse). We will earn this date night, we were determined. Eventually we switched to using latitude and longitude, and we were back on track.  
After intense effort from all parts of the team, the prayers of the TAs were answered. We had a fully functioning application. 

One wistful day, we’d like to add a location search function. Maybe our users dream of travel, and we’d like for them to take us with them. Additionally, we dream to eventually move past Zomato and never say its name again out loud again.
