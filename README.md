This app will use browser location data to find restaurants near the user's location.
The data for the restaurants is used to populate flags on a map and a list of restaurants found.
The restaurant list also includes a link to additional information on the restaurant.

Future ideas:
Provide a search input for cuisine type, location, etc...
Visually differentiate the You-Are-Here flag.
Populate new restaurants based on new map location when moving map.
